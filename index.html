<!-- About Me -->
<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    Daud Hasan is currently pursuing a Master of Science in Mechanical Engineering at Chittagong University of Engineering and Technology (CUET), under the supervision of Dr. Mamunur Roshid. His research focuses on turbulent boundary layers over flat plates, particularly investigating the effects using RANS models.
    He previously completed his undergraduate thesis in thermofluidics at Hajee Mohammad Danesh Science and Technology University (HSTU), where he worked under the guidance of Md. Jisan Mahmud. His project explored the lid-driven cavity flow problem and examined the influence of magnetic effects on fluid behavior.
